# Text-Mining-and-Sentiment-Analysis-in-Hotel-Booking

## Introduction 
Hotel reviews become one of the important factors that people consider when making hotel bookings. However, the hotel review records were not fully utilised and considered when mkaing marketing campaigns. Therefore, this study aims to conduct text mining using the dataset "Hotel Booking Demand" to investigate the relationsh between reviews and hotel booking rates. Using R studio, review data from "Hotel Booking Demand" was retrived and organised for further analysis. The term frequency matrix was performed and presented with no significant meanings. When scanning across multiple documents, term frequency alone provides an incomplete analysis of the true importance of a given word. Therefore, the study continued by combining term frequency with inverse document frequency to provide ingihts relating to the important terms in the review that associate with higher hotel booking rates. The terms with the highest collective importance using Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency are “great”, “nice”, “clean”, and “good”. This insight can be considered when generating marketing campaigns for hotels to raise the hotel booking rates.
